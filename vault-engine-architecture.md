# Vault Engine: Architecture Sketch

## Working Name: `vault-engine`

A local-first, MCP-native knowledge graph engine that wraps clean markdown files with agentic knowledge management capabilities. Editor-agnostic — works with Obsidian, Typora, VS Code, iA Writer, or anything that reads markdown. The agent is the primary interface for everything except reading and writing prose.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Markdown is canonical, full stop.** Every piece of structural data — types, fields, relationships — lives in the markdown (frontmatter + wiki-links). The database is always a derived index, rebuildable from the files at any time. If the DB is deleted, nothing is lost.
2. **Every meaningful entity gets its own file.** Tasks, projects, people, meetings — each is a separate `.md` file with its own frontmatter. This keeps files focused, linkable, and independently valid.
3. **Editor-agnostic by charter.** The engine watches a folder of markdown files. It does not depend on Obsidian, VS Code, or any specific editor or plugin. Any editor that opens `.md` files works.
4. **The agent is the primary interface.** Creating nodes, querying, managing tasks, organizing knowledge — all agent-driven via MCP tools. The editor is a viewport for reading and writing prose, not the control surface.
5. **Multi-typed, composable nodes.** Any node can have multiple types via a `types` array in frontmatter (e.g., `types: [meeting, task]`). Types are additive — they contribute fields and behaviors without constraining identity. Inheritance (e.g., `work-task` extends `task`) is resolved by the engine at the schema level.
6. **Relationships are wiki-links.** Connections between nodes are expressed as `[[wiki-links]]` in frontmatter fields or body content. The engine indexes these as typed relationships but does not invent relationships that aren't in the markdown.
7. **Runs on cheap models.** Tool interfaces are explicit, well-documented, and low-ambiguity. A 120B-class open model (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) should be able to use every tool correctly without chain-of-thought scaffolding. This means: explicit enum values, required fields clearly marked, examples in descriptions, structured JSON responses.
8. **Incremental by default.** Every operation — indexing, querying, syncing — handles single-file changes without full rebuilds.
9. **Schema-aware, not schema-enforced.** Schemas guide the agent and enable queries, but a file that violates schema is still valid markdown. The engine warns; it doesn't reject.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Language | TypeScript | Consistent with MCP SDK, strong typing for schema validation, broad ecosystem |
| Database | SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) | Single-file, no server, fast, WAL mode for concurrent reads, FTS5 for full-text search |
| Vector Store | sqlite-vss (preferred) or ChromaDB | sqlite-vss consolidates into one DB file, zero extra daemons; ChromaDB as fallback if richer vector ops needed |
| File Watching | `chokidar` | Mature, cross-platform, debounce-friendly |
| Markdown Parser | `unified` + `remark` + `mdast` | Produces a proper AST, extensible with plugins for wiki-links, frontmatter, block IDs |
| Frontmatter | `gray-matter` (or `remark-frontmatter` + `yaml`) | Standard YAML frontmatter parsing |
| MCP Server | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | Protocol layer for agent communication |
| Embedding | Local model via `ollama` or API call | For vector indexing; pluggable. `nomic-embed-text` or similar for local |
| Process Model | Single long-running Node process | Watches files, serves MCP, manages DB |

### Why SQLite over Postgres/Mongo/etc.

- Zero deployment. It's a file.
- Runs embedded in the same process as the MCP server.
- WAL mode allows concurrent reads while the engine writes (no lock contention on the DB — file-level conflicts are a separate concern).
- FTS5 gives you full-text search without another dependency.
- sqlite-vss keeps vectors in the same file, eliminating the need for a separate vector DB daemon.

### Why `unified`/`remark` over regex or custom parsing

- Produces a standard MDAST (Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree) that you can walk, transform, and serialize back.
- Plugins exist for frontmatter, GFM tables, math, etc.
- Round-trip fidelity: `remark-stringify` can reproduce markdown from the AST with minimal drift.
- You'll need AST manipulation for block ID injection, content extraction, and safe mutations.

### Wiki-Link Parsing: Two Strategies by Context

Wiki-links appear in two distinct contexts that require different extraction approaches:

**Body content → Custom remark plugin (AST nodes).**
Wiki-links in the document body (`## Notes\n\nTalk to [[Alice]] about the budget`) must be parsed as first-class AST nodes, not extracted via regex on text nodes. This is a ~40-50 line remark syntax extension that recognizes `[[target]]` and `[[target|alias]]` and emits a `wikiLink` node in the MDAST:

```
paragraph
  text: "Talk to "
  wikiLink (target: "Alice")        ← first-class node, not a text string
  text: " about the budget"
```

This is critical because the engine owns the write path, and write operations include **rename refactoring**. When `Alice.md` is renamed to `Alice Smith.md`, the engine must update every reference across the vault. With AST nodes, this is a safe structural operation: parse → walk → transform `wikiLink` nodes → serialize. The AST knows the difference between a wiki-link and text that happens to look like one (e.g., inside a code block). Without AST nodes, you're doing regex find-and-replace on raw strings, which is fragile and error-prone for edge cases like:

- `[[Alice]]` vs `[[Alice Cooper]]` (partial match risk)
- `[[Alice|our contact]]` → `[[Alice Smith|our contact]]` (alias preservation)
- Wiki-links inside fenced code blocks (must not be touched)
- Multiple wiki-links on the same line

The same AST-based approach is needed for any bulk refactoring: merging nodes, splitting nodes, changing schema type names, moving files and updating references.

**Frontmatter values → Regex extraction.**
Wiki-links in frontmatter (`assignee: "[[Alice Smith]]"`, `attendees: ["[[Alice]]", "[[Bob]]"]`) are embedded in YAML strings, not part of the MDAST. These must be extracted via regex (`/\[\[([^\]|]+)(?:\|([^\]]+))?\]\]/g`) applied to parsed YAML values. This is unavoidable — frontmatter is parsed separately by `gray-matter` as structured data, not as markdown.

For rename operations in frontmatter, the engine updates the YAML values directly (parse YAML → find matching strings → replace → serialize YAML), which is safe because frontmatter structure is simple and well-defined.

**Summary:** Regex for frontmatter (no alternative), AST nodes for body content (safety and correctness require it).

## Schema Definition Format

Schemas live as YAML files in a `.schemas/` directory in the vault root (or a configurable location). Schemas are composable: a node can have multiple types, and types can extend other types.

### Multi-Typing in Frontmatter

A node's types are declared as an array in frontmatter. The engine merges fields from all applicable schemas:

```markdown
---
title: Q1 Planning Meeting
types: [meeting, task]
# fields from 'meeting' schema:
date: 2025-03-06
attendees: ["[[Alice Smith]]", "[[Bob Jones]]"]
# fields from 'task' schema:
status: todo
assignee: "[[Alice Smith]]"
due_date: 2025-03-05
---

Prep the deck and circulate agenda before the meeting.
```

The engine knows `date` and `attendees` come from the `meeting` schema, while `status`, `assignee`, and `due_date` come from the `task` schema. Validation merges field definitions from all types. If two types define the same field name with compatible types, they share it. If incompatible, the engine warns.

### Schema Inheritance

A schema can extend another schema, inheriting all its fields:

```yaml
# .schemas/task.yaml
name: task
display_name: Task
icon: ✅

fields:
  status:
    type: enum
    values: [todo, in-progress, blocked, done, cancelled]
    default: todo
    required: true
  assignee:
    type: reference
    target_schema: person
  due_date:
    type: date
  priority:
    type: enum
    values: [critical, high, medium, low]
    default: medium
  source:
    type: reference                   # What meeting/project spawned this

serialization:
  filename_template: "tasks/{{title}}.md"
  frontmatter_fields: [status, assignee, due_date, priority, source]
```

```yaml
# .schemas/work-task.yaml
name: work-task
display_name: Work Task
icon: 💼
extends: task                          # Inherits all fields from task

fields:
  # Additional fields specific to work tasks
  project:
    type: reference
    target_schema: project
  department:
    type: string
  billable:
    type: boolean
    default: false

serialization:
  filename_template: "tasks/work/{{title}}.md"
  frontmatter_fields: [status, assignee, due_date, priority, source, project, department, billable]
```

A file with `types: [work-task]` automatically gets all `task` fields plus `project`, `department`, and `billable`. The engine resolves the inheritance chain — the frontmatter doesn't need to say `types: [task, work-task]` (though it can).

### Relationship Model

Relationships between nodes are expressed entirely as wiki-links in markdown. The engine categorizes them:

- **Frontmatter references**: `assignee: "[[Alice Smith]]"` → typed relationship (`assignee` → person node)
- **Body wiki-links**: `[[Send budget spreadsheet]]` in the meeting body → contextual relationship (engine stores surrounding text)
- **Source backlinks**: `source: "[[Q1 Planning Meeting]]"` → explicit provenance

The engine indexes all wiki-links and resolves them to node IDs. The relationship type is inferred from context: frontmatter key name for frontmatter refs, or `wiki-link` for body links. No relationships exist in the DB that aren't derivable from the markdown.

### Core Schema Definitions

```yaml
# .schemas/project.yaml
name: project
display_name: Project
icon: 🎯

fields:
  status:
    type: enum
    values: [active, paused, completed, archived]
    default: active
    required: true
  owner:
    type: reference
    target_schema: person
    required: true
  stakeholders:
    type: list<reference>
    target_schema: person
  timeline_start:
    type: date
  timeline_end:
    type: date
  priority:
    type: enum
    values: [critical, high, medium, low]
    default: medium
  tags:
    type: list<string>

serialization:
  filename_template: "projects/{{title}}.md"
  frontmatter_fields: [status, owner, stakeholders, timeline_start, timeline_end, priority, tags]

computed:
  task_count:
    query: "COUNT nodes WHERE types INCLUDES 'task' AND source REFERENCES this"
  completion_pct:
    query: "COUNT(status='done') / COUNT(*) WHERE types INCLUDES 'task' AND source REFERENCES this"
```

```yaml
# .schemas/person.yaml
name: person
display_name: Person
icon: 👤

fields:
  role:
    type: string
  company:
    type: string
  email:
    type: string
  phone:
    type: string
  tags:
    type: list<string>

serialization:
  filename_template: "people/{{title}}.md"
  frontmatter_fields: [role, company, email, phone, tags]
```

```yaml
# .schemas/meeting.yaml
name: meeting
display_name: Meeting
icon: 📅

fields:
  date:
    type: date
    required: true
  attendees:
    type: list<reference>
    target_schema: person
  project:
    type: reference
    target_schema: project
  status:
    type: enum
    values: [scheduled, completed, cancelled]
    default: scheduled

serialization:
  filename_template: "meetings/{{date}}-{{title}}.md"
  frontmatter_fields: [date, attendees, project, status]
```

## Block ID Strategy

Block IDs let the engine address individual elements within a file — headings, bullets, paragraphs. Since every meaningful entity gets its own file, block IDs are a secondary concern: they enable sub-file references (e.g., linking to a specific bullet in a meeting note) but aren't required for the core workflow.

### Approach: Obsidian-Compatible `^block-id` Syntax

Following Obsidian's convention for maximum editor compatibility:

```markdown
## Discussion Points

- We need to finalize the budget by Friday ^budget-deadline
  - Alice will send the updated spreadsheet ^alice-spreadsheet
  - Bob to review vendor proposals ^bob-vendors
```

Obsidian renders these as invisible anchors and supports linking to them via `[[file#^block-id]]`. Other editors show them as plain text (harmless). The engine assigns IDs automatically on first index using short nanoids (e.g., `^ve-x1y2z` with a `ve-` prefix to distinguish engine-generated IDs from user-created ones).

### ID Rules

1. **Generated on first index** when the engine encounters a block without an ID.
2. **Persisted in the file** as trailing `^id` syntax per Obsidian convention.
3. **Stable across edits.** Moving a block preserves its ID. Engine detects moved blocks by content similarity.
4. **Short and namespaced.** Engine-generated IDs use `^ve-xxxxx` (5-char nanoid) to avoid collision with user-created block refs.
5. **Opt-in per vault.** Disable in config to fall back to position-based addressing (less stable but zero file modification).
6. **File-level nodes don't need block IDs.** File path is the stable identifier for file-level nodes.

### When Block IDs Matter

- Linking to a specific section from another file's frontmatter or body
- Agent referencing a specific bullet to update ("mark the third action item as done")
- Future: extracting a block into its own file while preserving incoming links

For v1, block IDs are nice-to-have. The "every entity is a file" principle means most addressable things have file paths as IDs.

## MCP Tool Definitions

Tool design principle: every tool should be usable by a 120B-class model without ambiguity. This means explicit parameter types, clear descriptions with examples, and structured responses. Prefer multiple focused tools over fewer multi-purpose tools.

### Query Tools

```typescript
// Structured search with schema-aware filtering
tool("query-nodes", {
  description: "Search for nodes by type, field values, and text. Examples: 'find all tasks where status is todo', 'find projects owned by Alice'. Returns a list of matching nodes with their fields.",
  params: {
    schema_type: z.string().optional()
      .describe("Schema type to filter by, e.g. 'task', 'project', 'meeting', 'person'. A node matches if it has this type in its types array (supports multi-typed nodes)."),
    filters: z.array(z.object({
      field: z.string().describe("Field name, e.g. 'status', 'assignee', 'due_date'"),
      operator: z.enum(["eq", "neq", "gt", "lt", "gte", "lte", "contains", "in"])
        .describe("eq: equals, neq: not equals, gt/lt/gte/lte: comparison, contains: substring, in: value in list"),
      value: z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean(), z.array(z.string())])
    })).optional(),
    full_text: z.string().optional().describe("Full-text search query against node content"),
    limit: z.number().default(20),
    order_by: z.string().optional().describe("Sort field and direction, e.g. 'due_date ASC', 'updated_at DESC'"),
  }
});

// Semantic search (vector similarity)
tool("semantic-search", {
  description: "Find nodes semantically similar to a natural language query",
  params: {
    query: z.string(),
    schema_type: z.string().optional(),
    filters: z.array(/* same as above */).optional(),
    limit: z.number().default(10),
  }
});

// Graph traversal
tool("traverse-graph", {
  description: "Find nodes connected to a given node within N hops",
  params: {
    node_id: z.string(),
    rel_types: z.array(z.string()).optional(),   // filter by relationship type
    direction: z.enum(["outgoing", "incoming", "both"]).default("both"),
    max_depth: z.number().default(2),
    target_schema: z.string().optional(),
  }
});
```

### Read Tools

```typescript
tool("get-node", {
  description: "Get full details of a specific node by ID or file path",
  params: {
    node_id: z.string().optional(),
    file_path: z.string().optional(),
    include_children: z.boolean().default(false),
    include_relationships: z.boolean().default(false),
  }
});

tool("get-recent", {
  description: "Get recently created or modified nodes",
  params: {
    schema_type: z.string().optional(),
    since: z.string().optional(),              // ISO date
    limit: z.number().default(20),
  }
});

tool("list-types", {
  description: "List all types that exist in indexed data, with node counts. Shows what types nodes actually have (from frontmatter), as opposed to list-schemas which shows what's defined in YAML. These can diverge — a schema can exist with no nodes using it, and nodes can have types with no schema definition.",
  params: {
    include_counts: z.boolean().default(true),
  }
});
```

### Mutation Tools

```typescript

  params: {
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.string(),
    attendees: z.array(z.string()),            // names — engine resolves to person nodes

    agenda: z.string().optional(),
  }
});

tool("extract-action-items", {
  description: "Parse a node's content for action items and create linked action-item nodes",
  params: {
    source_node_id: z.string(),
    auto_assign: z.boolean().default(true),    // Try to match @mentions to person nodes
  }
});

tool("daily-summary", {
  description: "Generate a summary of today's changes, due items, and active projects",
  params: {
    date: z.string().optional(),               // defaults to today

### Avoiding Infinite Loops

When the engine writes a file (via mutation), the watcher will pick it up. To avoid re-indexing what we just wrote:

1. **Write lock**: Engine sets a flag with the file path before writing. Watcher checks the flag and skips.
2. **Content hash check**: After writing, store the hash. When watcher fires, compare hash — if identical, skip.
3. **Both**: Belt and suspenders.

### Reference Resolution on Incremental Index

When a file is added or changed, the indexer re-resolves all unresolved references across the vault — not just refs in the changed file. A newly added `Alice Smith.md` should resolve dangling `[[Alice Smith]]` refs in any existing node's relationships. This is a single indexed query over the relationships table filtered to unresolved targets, not a file scan, so the cost is acceptable.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Read-Only Foundation (Weeks 1–3)

**Goal:** Index a vault into SQLite, serve read queries via MCP.

- [ ] Markdown parser pipeline (unified/remark → MDAST)
- [ ] Custom remark plugin: parse `[[target|alias]]` into first-class `wikiLink` AST nodes
- [ ] Frontmatter extraction with `types` array support (gray-matter + regex for wiki-links in YAML values)
- [ ] Wiki-link extraction from body via AST node walking (not regex on text nodes)
- [ ] SQLite schema creation + node/node_types/field/relationship insertion
- [ ] File watcher with debounce
- [ ] Incremental indexing (only changed files)
- [ ] Full rebuild command
- [ ] MCP tools: `get-node`, `query-nodes`, `get-recent`, `list-types`
- [ ] Basic FTS5 search

**Milestone:** Agent can query the vault structurally: "find all nodes with types including task where status is todo" returns correct results.

### Phase 2: Schema System + Multi-Typing (Weeks 4–5)

**Goal:** YAML-driven schema definitions with inheritance, multi-type field merging, validation on index, reference resolution, and schema introspection MCP tools.

- [ ] Schema TypeScript types (`SchemaDefinition`, `FieldDefinition`, `ResolvedSchema`)
- [ ] YAML schema loader with `extends` inheritance resolution
- [ ] Schema storage in `schemas` DB table
- [ ] Multi-type field merging (union fields from all types on a node)
- [ ] Schema validation on index (warn, don't reject)
- [ ] Reference resolution (wiki-link title → node ID lookup; incremental index does full pass over unresolved refs)
- [ ] MCP tools: `list-schemas`, `describe-schema`, `validate-node`
- [ ] Computed field evaluation (count, percentage aggregations)

**Milestone:** Agent can ask "describe the work-task schema" and see inherited + own fields. Indexing validates files against their schemas and reports warnings. Wiki-link references resolve to node IDs. Queries filter by any type in the multi-type array (already works from Phase 1, now schema-aware).

### Phase 3: Write Path (Weeks 6–8)

**Goal:** Agent can create and modify nodes that serialize to clean markdown files.

- [ ] Markdown serializer (structured data → .md file with clean frontmatter + body)
- [ ] `create-node` tool with multi-type schema validation
- [ ] `update-node` tool (field updates, body append/replace)
- [ ] `add-relationship` tool (writes wiki-links into frontmatter or body)
- [ ] `rename-node` tool (renames file + updates all wiki-link references vault-wide via AST transformation for body, YAML-aware replacement for frontmatter)
- [ ] Write lock / hash check to prevent watcher loops
- [ ] Batch mutation support (`batch-mutate` tool)
- [ ] File path generation from schema `filename_template`

**Milestone:** "Create a work-task called 'Review vendor proposals' assigned to Bob, due Friday, linked to the CenterPoint project" produces a valid, well-formatted markdown file in the right directory with correct frontmatter.

### Phase 4: Vector Search Integration (Weeks 9–10)

**Goal:** Semantic search alongside structured queries.

- [ ] Embedding pipeline (chunk → embed → store)
- [ ] sqlite-vss integration (or ChromaDB fallback)
- [ ] `semantic-search` MCP tool
- [ ] Hybrid queries (semantic similarity + structured field filters)
- [ ] Incremental embedding updates on file change

**Milestone:** "Find notes related to infrastructure migration from Q4" returns semantically relevant results, filterable by type and field values.

### Phase 5: Graph Traversal + Block IDs (Weeks 11–12)

**Goal:** Relationship navigation and optional sub-file addressing.

- [ ] `traverse-graph` MCP tool (N-hop traversal with type/direction filters)
- [ ] Incoming/outgoing relationship queries
- [ ] Block ID injection (Obsidian-compatible `^ve-xxxxx` syntax, opt-in)
- [ ] Block-level node creation in DB
- [ ] Block-level reference and mutation support

**Milestone:** Agent can traverse the knowledge graph: "what's connected to the CenterPoint project within 2 hops?" returns people, meetings, tasks. Block-level addressing works for users who opt in.

### Phase 6: Task Management + Workflow Tools (Weeks 13–16)

**Goal:** Higher-level tools that compose primitives into productive workflows.

- [ ] `create-meeting-notes` — creates meeting file, links attendees and project
- [ ] `extract-tasks` — parses a node's content for action items, creates linked task files
- [ ] `daily-summary` — aggregates due items, recent changes, active projects
- [ ] `overdue-tasks` — finds tasks past due date
- [ ] `project-status` — summarizes a project's tasks by status, completion %, blockers
- [ ] Error handling, edge cases, conflict resolution hardening
- [ ] Performance tuning (index speed, query latency for vaults with 1000+ files)
- [ ] Documentation + setup guide

**Milestone:** Usable daily driver. Agent can orchestrate multi-step knowledge management: "Create notes for today's CenterPoint meeting with Alice and Bob, then extract the action items as tasks and assign them."

---

## Resolved Decisions

1. **Block IDs: Obsidian-compatible `^block-id` syntax.** With engine-generated `^ve-xxxxx` prefix. Opt-out available in config for position-based fallback.

2. **Vector store: sqlite-vss preferred.** Consolidates everything into one DB file, zero extra daemons. ChromaDB available as config switch if richer vector ops needed.

3. **Schema strictness: warn, don't reject.** Files that violate schema are still indexed (they're valid markdown). Engine flags them with `is_valid: false` in the DB so queries can filter if desired.

4. **Wiki-link resolution: by title match (Obsidian convention).** Shortest unique match wins. Engine maintains a title → node_id lookup table, rebuilt on index. Explicit paths also supported.

5. **Multi-vault: not in v1.** Single vault only. Multi-vault adds cross-vault linking complexity not worth solving yet.

6. **Editor interaction: none by design.** The engine is editor-agnostic. It doesn't integrate with any editor's plugin system. It watches files on disk. Editors are viewports.

7. **Data authority: markdown is canonical.** The DB is a rebuildable index. Blow it away, re-index, and nothing is lost. Structure (types, fields, relationships) lives in frontmatter and wiki-links.

8. **Embedding model: local via ollama, pluggable.** Default to `nomic-embed-text` for local. API option (OpenAI, etc.) available for users who want better embeddings.

9. **Field name collisions in multi-typing: union enum values and warn.** If two types define the same field with compatible types, they share it. If incompatible (same name, different type), the engine warns and keeps both definitions. Enum fields with the same name get their value sets unioned.

10. **Schema migration: leave existing files alone, warn on validation.** When a schema definition changes, existing files are not modified. Missing required fields get warnings on next index. The engine never writes default values into existing files on schema change.

11. **Schema change does not trigger re-validation of existing nodes.** A change to `.schemas/*.yaml` triggers a full schema reload, but nodes are only re-validated on their next individual re-index. Full vault re-validation on schema change is expensive and unnecessary for a warn-don't-reject system.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Wiki-link target creation.** If the agent writes `assignee: "[[Alice Smith]]"` but no `Alice Smith.md` exists yet, should the engine auto-create a stub file? Or leave it as a dangling reference? Propose: agent explicitly creates person nodes; dangling refs are indexed but flagged.

2. **Concurrent editing.** User edits a file in their editor while the agent is writing to the same file via a mutation tool. Current approach: write lock + hash check. May need file-level locking or operational transform for robustness. Likely fine for v1 since conflicts should be rare.

---

## Future Capabilities (Post-v1)

These are acknowledged goals but explicitly deferred. They should not drive architectural decisions for the core engine. Each should be implementable as an additional MCP tool module that composes with the existing primitives.

### Task & Project Management Tools
- Kanban-style views (rendered as auto-generated markdown files or served via MCP resource)
- Sprint/cycle management (group tasks by time period)
- Dependency tracking between tasks (`blocked_by` field)
- Recurring task generation
- Dashboard/summary generation ("what's overdue? what's due this week?")
- These build on the core `task` and `project` schemas + query tools

### Web Clipper
- Clip web pages to markdown files with metadata (URL, title, date clipped, tags)
- Clean HTML → markdown conversion (readability extraction)
- Auto-type as a `clip` schema node
- Could be an MCP tool (`clip-url`) or a separate lightweight service/bookmarklet that writes to the vault

### YouTube & Audio Transcription
- Accept a YouTube URL or audio file, transcribe via whisper.cpp or Whisper API
- Save as a markdown file with `types: [transcript]` and metadata (source URL, duration, date)
- Optional: agent summarizes the transcript and extracts action items
- Dependency: whisper.cpp or API access (not part of core engine)

### Web Search
- Agent-accessible web search via SearXNG (self-hosted) or Tavily API
- Returns structured results the agent can use to enrich nodes, answer questions, or create clip nodes
- Dependency: search service (not part of core engine, accessed as external MCP tool or direct API call)
